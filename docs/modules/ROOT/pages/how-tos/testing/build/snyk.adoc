= Enabling a Snyk task

The Snyk test is available to run at build time in the default pipelines, but it requires additional configuration to enable. This procedural example illustrates a build-time test that requires the configuration of a custom secret.

The `sast-snyk-check` task uses the Snyk Code tool to perform static application security testing (SAST). 
Specifically, the Snyk check scans an application's source code for potential security vulnerabilities, 
including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection attack vulnerabilities.

NOTE: You can run a Snyk task only if you have a Snyk token configured in a namespace secret. Ensure that the name of your secret is included in the *snyk-secret* pipeline parameter.
