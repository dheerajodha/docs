= Build-time tests

This document covers the build-time tests that {ProductName} runs as part of its component build pipeline. These build-time tests automatically check all application images to inform you if they're up-to-date, correctly formatted, and protected from security vulnerabilities.

NOTE: These tests are non-blocking and do not prevent the pipeline from proceeding if issues are found.

The component build pipeline for {ProductName} include various types of build-time tests, conducted using link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#overview[Tekton tasks]. For validating container information, the pipeline employs https://www.conftest.dev/[Conftest]. 

The table below outlines the default build-time tests:
